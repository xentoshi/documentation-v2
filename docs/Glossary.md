| Quote Asset Reserve  | means the virtual quote reserves for a market (e.g. USDC reserves in a SOL/USDC virtual pool).&#x20;                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| Peg Multiplier       | means the magnitude of the quote asset reserve. For instance, one virtual quote asset reserve is a peg multiplier amount of the quote asset. &#xA;&#xA;A peg multiplier ensures that the base asset reserve and the quote asset reserve are balanced at the initialisation of the curve while ensuring that the starting price of the pool is equivalent to the oracle price of the base asset at initialisation. |
| Reserve Price        | in the AMM, is defined as `(quote_asset_reserve * peg_multiplier)  / base_asset_reserve`. It is the true reserves price prior to any spread logic.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

| Terminal Price&#x20; | means the mark price if all users atomically closed their positions and no repegs/k adjustments occurred (should be equal to the peg multiplier if all k adjustments were done during a balanced market).                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
